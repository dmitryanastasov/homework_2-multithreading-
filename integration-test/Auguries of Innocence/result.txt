To see a World in a Grain of Sand 33
And a Heaven in a Wild Flower, 30
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand 38
And Eternity in an hour. 24

A Robin Red breast in a Cage 28
Puts all Heaven in a Rage. 26
A dove house fill'd with doves & Pigeons 40
Shudders Hell thro' all its regions. 36
A dog starv'd at his Master's Gate 34
Predicts the ruin of the State. 31
A Horse misus'd upon the Road 29
Calls to Heaven for Human blood. 32
Each outcry of the hunted Hare 30
A fibre from the Brain does tear. 33
A Skylark wounded in the wing, 30
A Cherubim does cease to sing. 30
The Game Cock clipp'd and arm'd for fight 41
Does the Rising Sun affright. 29
Every Wolf's & Lion's howl 26
Raises from Hell a Human Soul. 30
The wild deer, wand'ring here & there, 38
Keeps the Human Soul from Care. 31
The Lamb misus'd breeds public strife 37
And yet forgives the Butcher's Knife. 37
The Bat that flits at close of Eve 34
Has left the Brain that won't believe. 38
The Owl that calls upon the Night 33
Speaks the Unbeliever's fright. 31
He who shall hurt the little Wren 33
Shall never be belov'd by Men. 30
He who the Ox to wrath has mov'd 32
Shall never be by Woman lov'd. 30
The wanton Boy that kills the Fly 33
Shall feel the Spider's enmity. 31
He who torments the Chafer's sprite 35
Weaves a Bower in endless Night. 32
The Catterpillar on the Leaf 28
Repeats to thee thy Mother's grief. 35
Kill not the Moth nor Butterfly, 32
For the Last Judgement draweth nigh. 36
He who shall train the Horse to War 35
Shall never pass the Polar Bar. 31
The Beggar's Dog & Widow's Cat, 31
Feed them & thou wilt grow fat. 31
The Gnat that sings his Summer's song 37

The poison of the Snake & Newt 30
Is the sweat of Envy's Foot. 28
The poison of the Honey Bee 27
Is the Artist's Jealousy. 25
The Prince's Robes & Beggars' Rags 34
Are Toadstools on the Miser's Bags. 35
A truth that's told with bad intent 35
Beats all the Lies you can invent. 34
It is right it should be so; 28
Man was made for Joy & Woe; 27
And when this we rightly know 29
Thro' the World we safely go. 29
Joy & Woe are woven fine, 25
A Clothing for the Soul divine; 31
Under every grief & pine 24
Runs a joy with silken twine. 29
The Babe is more than swadling Bands; 37
Throughout all these Human Lands 32
Tools were made, & born were hands, 35
Every Farmer Understands. 25
Every Tear from Every Eye 25
Becomes a Babe in Eternity. 27
This is caught by Females bright 32
And return'd to its own delight. 32
The Bleat, the Bark, Bellow & Roar 34
Are Waves that Beat on Heaven's Shore. 38
The Babe that weeps the Rod beneath 35
Writes Revenge in realms of death. 34
The Beggar's Rags, fluttering in Air, 37
Does to Rags the Heavens tear. 30
The Soldier arm'd with Sword & Gun, 35
Palsied strikes the Summer's Sun. 33
The poor Man's Farthing is worth more 37
Than all the Gold on Afric's Shore. 35
One Mite wrung from the Labrer's hands 38
Shall buy & sell the Miser's lands: 35
Or, if protected from on high, 30
Does that whole Nation sell & buy. 34
He who mocks the Infant's Faith 31
Shall be mock'd in Age & Death. 31
He who shall teach the Child to Doubt 37
The rotting Grave shall ne'er get out. 38
He who respects the Infant's faith 34
Triumph's over Hell & Death. 28
The Child's Toys & the Old Man's Reasons 40
Are the Fruits of the Two seasons. 34
The Questioner, who sits so sly, 32
Shall never know how to Reply. 30
He who replies to words of Doubt 32
Doth put the Light of Knowledge out. 36
The Strongest Poison ever known 31
Came from Caesar's Laurel Crown. 32
Nought can deform the Human Race 32
Like the Armour's iron brace. 29
When Gold & Gems adorn the Plow 31
To peaceful Arts shall Envy Bow. 32
A Riddle or the Cricket's Cry 29
Is to Doubt a fit Reply. 24
The Emmet's Inch & Eagle's Mile 31
Make Lame Philosophy to smile. 30
He who Doubts from what he sees 31
Will ne'er believe, do what you Please. 39
If the Sun & Moon should doubt 30
They'd immediately Go out. 26
To be in a Passion you Good may do, 35
But no Good if a Passion is in you. 35
The Whore & Gambler, by the State 33
Licenc'd, build that Nation's Fate. 35
The Harlot's cry from Street to Street 38
Shall weave Old England's winding Sheet. 40
The Winner's Shout, the Loser's Curse, 38
Dance before dead England's Hearse. 35
Every Night & every Morn 24
Some to Misery are Born. 24
Every Morn & every Night 24
Some are Born to sweet Delight. 31
Some ar Born to sweet Delight, 30
Some are born to Endless Night. 31
We are led to Believe a Lie 27
When we see not Thro' the Eye 29
Which was Born in a Night to Perish in a Night 46
When the Soul Slept in Beams of Light. 38
God Appears & God is Light 26
To those poor Souls who dwell in the Night, 43
But does a Human Form Display 29
To those who Dwell in Realms of day. 36
